# Molecule DSL (Mol-DSL)

We have developed a DSL for describing a UI 'widget' (a collection of UI elements that form a cohesive
while; for example, a _dialog box_) that reflects the principles of (Atomic Design)[https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com]. 
The 'widget' is defined as a (Directed Graph)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph] where sources of data, individual 
UI elements, and some other functional components are the _nodes_, and the input/output relationships between the elements 
are the _edges_.

## Atomic Design
