Specifically, we designed this demo.src.catalog to support the needs of:\n\n- Developers\n- Designers\n- Product Owners\n- End Users\n\n#### Developers\n\nFor Developers, this demo.src.catalog shows all the UI software components _in use_. You can see how the component works, what it looks like,\nhow it interacts with data and configuration, etc. Each example also includes a snippet\nof source code that shows how you can use the component in your own solutions.\n\nAdditionally, by working with each component in\nisolation, Developers can simplify and streamline the development of new, or custom, components. You can focus on building just the\nfunctionality your clients need, without spending time an effort on extraneous details, like Servers, Databases, Deployment,\nand other external concerns.\n\n#### Designers\n\nMuch like Developers, Designers can use the demo.src.catalog to see the whole range of UI Components available for them to use\nin their own solutions. In many cases, there are multiple options for a given Component. Sometimes they vary by the\nsource library they are drawn from (we re-package such components to make them interchangeable with minimal software code\nchanges). Sometimes they vary in how they work, with the different options suited to different situations. Having options\ngives you the freedom to choose what works best for you and your clients.\n\n#### Product Owners\n\nProduct Owners can use the demo.src.catalog to get a _sense of the possible_. Having the entire collection of components at your\nfingertips can be both liberating, and somewhat overwhelming. But knowing what is possible can help you have more\nmeaningful conversations with your Users, Designers, and Developers.\n\n#### End Users\n\nEnd Users can use this demo.src.catalog in much the same way as the Product Owners; as a way to see what is possible. Many times, users\nfind it difficult to express their needs to technical people. Having a demo.src.catalog that everyone shares can help make it easier to\nexpress your needs and desires in a concrete way, with the immediate feedback provided by everyone looking at the same visual\nrepresentation.\"])\n\n"]}
