A lot has been said about creating\ndesign systems, and much of it focuses on establishing\nfoundations for color, typography, grids, texture and the like. This type of thinking is certainly\nimportant, but I\u2019m slightly less interested in these aspects of design because ultimately they are\nand will always be subjective. Lately I\u2019ve been more interested in what our interfaces are comprised\nof and how we can construct design systems in a more methodical way.\n\nIn searching for inspiration and parallels, I kept coming back to chemistry. The thought is that all\nmatter (whether solid, liquid, gas, simple, complex, etc.) is comprised of atoms. Those atomic units\nbond together to form molecules, which in turn combine into more complex organisms to ultimately create\nall matter in our universe. Similarly, interfaces are made up of smaller components. This means we can\nbreak entire interfaces\ndown into fundamental building blocks and work up from there. That\u2019s the basic gist of atomic design.\n\n- Brad Frost\n\n![atomic-design](/imgs/atomic-design.png)\n\nDuring our development of _modern_ user interfaces using Atomic Design and ClojureScript, we came to realized that\nthe molecule as an organized collection of atoms, like that shown below, was the key to unlocking a superpowered way\nto develop User Interfaces.\n\n![molecule](/imgs/glucose-molecule.jpg)\n\nA molecule is a ***graph!*** The _atoms_ are the nodes, and the _bonds_ between them are the edges!\n\nWhen combined with the notion of Event Modeling as a means to describe the entire system as a directed graph,\nwe consider the _directed graph_ as a single, powerful abstraction of Information Systems as a whole. We've developed\nan approach to UI development which takes advantage of this powerful abstraction.\n\n\n> For more information on Atomic Design, please see [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)\n    ");
