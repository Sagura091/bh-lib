In other words, our\n> execution environment is constrained by the shape and demands of the application we are working on.\n> This is extremely limiting.\"\n\nWe agree. Therefore, we developed this demo.src.catalog both as a means to show off the breadth of UI Components available to\nus as Professional Software Developers, but also to allow us to work more quickly and more easily by isolating the development\nof the components from the development of the User-facing solutions that will be built _from_ those components.\n\n\nWe are confident in this approach, as it has been adopted by a number of other Companies and Communities across many\ndifferent markets, approaches, and technologies:\n\n- [Astro UXDS](https://www.astrouxds.com)\n- [Devcards](https://github.com/bhuiauman/devcards)\n- [Workspaces](https://github.com/nubank/workspaces)\n- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org), also [Storybook in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdlTFPebzAU)\n- [Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com)\n\n"], null);
